# dotfiles
My Linux ricing files. 

Currently it's configured to a OneShot theme.
The Terminus font that I reference is a TTF version obtainable here:
- **Source**: https://files.ax86.net/terminus-ttf/
- **AUR**: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/terminus-font-ttf/

I recommend using this font for the config, to make sure that text renders nicely. However, you can use a combination of Terminess Nerd Font and the otb version of the Terminus font to achieve the same look.

### Programs/packages I refer to
```
alacritty
conky
dunst
dex
feh
i3-gaps
neofetch
polybar
vim
xcompmgr
zsh
```
Some of my scripts also rely on python3.
